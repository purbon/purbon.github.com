<p class="message">
I'm Pere Urbon‑Bayes, a Software Architect with over 15 years of experience in data engineering, streaming systems, and scalable infrastructure. Before transitioning into industry, I spent nearly a decade in academia, publishing research on semantic technologies, information extraction, and data quality. Today, I design real-time data platforms using tools like Apache Kafka, Elasticsearch, and GitOps-based automation. I’m also an active speaker, open-source contributor, and educator—focused on bridging data, infrastructure, and developer experience.</p>
